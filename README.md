# Real-Time Face Recognition with Database Integration

## Description
This project implements real-time face recognition using machine learning techniques, integrating it with a database for real-time storage and retrieval of recognized faces. It aims to identify individuals in live video streams or images and stores relevant information in a database for further analysis or action.

## Features
- **Face Detection**: Utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect faces in real-time.
- **Face Recognition**: Recognizes and identifies individuals based on stored data or training sets.
- **Database Integration**: Integrates a database to store recognized faces and associated information.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Performs face recognition in live video streams or images.
- **Data Persistence**: Stores recognized faces and related metadata in the database.
- **User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interaction and management.
- **Security and Privacy**: Implements secure methods for storing and accessing facial data.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Configure Database**: Set up and configure the database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).

## Usage
Once the project is set up, here's how to use the application:

1. **Run the Application**: Start the face recognition system.
2. **Capture Video/Upload Image**: Use live video streams or upload images for face recognition.
3. **Real-Time Recognition**: Recognize faces in real-time and store information in the database.
4. **Database Interaction**: Access and manage recognized faces and associated data in the database.
